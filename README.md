# ML Dataset Generation branch

Before running jobs, edit `submit_process.sh` to point to your `2x2-sim` directory. Edit `run_sequence.txt` to be sure that the files are placed in your desired SCRATCH directory. Each step will generate N files (where n is in the sequence from 0 to 25). 

To run a job, do the following:

`sbatch submit_process.sh`

To check the job's status, type `squeue -u <username>`. 

If you would like to edit the interactions in the genie step, change the `gevgen_fnal` arguments in `2x2_sim/run-genie/run_genie.sh`. For more information about arguments, see section 5.3.1 in [the Genie documentation](https://genie-docdb.pp.rl.ac.uk/DocDB/0000/000002/007/1510.05494v1.pdf). Note that the command on line 57 is `gevgen`, not `gevgen_fnal`. 

The output files should be located in your `$ARCUBE_OUTDIR_BASE/run-convert2h5/Tutorial.convert2h5/EDEPSIM_H5/0000000/`. This will contain a number of `.hdf5` files which should be transferred to its-og. These hdf5 files are the input to the array generator code in `neutrino_interaction_CNN`. 

# Other dataset generation branches

The other branches on this fork have code that might work for Argon-40 de-excitation gammas and argon-39 beta decay. To swap to a different branch, try:

`git checkout argon40-gamma`

NOTE: git won't let you swap branches without "stashing" or "committing" your changes. See [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) for more information.

The `argon40-gamma` `run_sequence.txt` file doesn't contain a genie step, so it instead will generate the de-excitation gammas from the `run-edep-sim` step. The changes should be made in this macro file `run-edep-sim/macros/2x2_beam.mac`. 


# 2x2_sim
Wrappers for ArgonCube 2x2 simulation designed to be run at NERSC.

Support for other computing clusters/environments using Singularity is now available and is configured by environment variable(s). Certain parts of the simulation chain (e.g. edep-sim) require large input files and need to be downloaded from NERSC or regenerated.

The repository wiki has a variety of useful information related to running and using the 2x2 simulation:

+ A tutorial on how to run the simulation can be found at [Tutorial on running 2x2_sim](https://github.com/DUNE/2x2_sim/wiki/Tutorial-on-running-2x2_sim)
+ Information on the data/variables inside the different output files can be found at [File data definitions](https://github.com/DUNE/2x2_sim/wiki/File-data-definitions)

Additional information may be found on the [ND-Prototype Analysis page(s)](https://wiki.dunescience.org/wiki/ND_Prototype_Analysis) on the DUNE wiki.
